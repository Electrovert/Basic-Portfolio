     <p>
            Web development did not come naturally to me, instead, it came to me one day while editing a training document at work. 
            I realized that I had absolutely no idea how any of the internet worked; never mind how the HTML I was writing affected the page I was editing. This created a thirst for more information.
            Though I did find many online coding courses, I could not connect to what I was learning in a meaningful way.
            This is why I decided to come to UNH's Coding Bootcamp.

               My main objective with web development is to help people in an impactful way.<br> 
               Not reinventing the wheel by any means, instead I'd like to bridge the gap for individuals needing and not receiving mental health services.<br>
