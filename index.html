     <!--First Paragraph-->
            <p>
            Web development did not come to me naturally, I was not one that started coding before high school.
            Instead, it came to me one day while editing a training document at work. I realized that I had absolutely no idea how any of the internet worked.
            Never mind how the HTML I was writing affected the page I was editing. This created a thirst for more information.
            After taking a rudimentary class at my local Adult Learning Center, it became stunningly clear that this was not sufficient. I needed more.
            I then became introduced with the myriad of free coding courses online in an attempt to teach myself; which was initially successful.
            This again was not enough, I could not connect to what I was learning in a meaningful way.
            After some research online, I found the UNH Coding Bootcamp. It ticked all the boxes I was looking for, and I have not looked back.

        <!--Second Paragraph-->
        <p>
               My main objective with web development is to help people in an impactful way.<br> 
               I'm not looking to reinvent the wheel, I just want to engage with children through adults who need mental health services that are currently unavailable to them.<br>
               This could mean BCT, a meeting with their guidance counselor to report an instance, or something that happened at home that left them unsettled; really just anything.<br>
               It is my hope that I can hep those that need it the most, that need to know they are not alone, and that there are services out there for them.
